# Birthday-API  

Birthday-API is a REST API that has one endpoint /hello/{username} and it allows two operations:  

*GET /hello/{username}* this endpoint returns:
  - 404 ERROR, if the username does not exist
  - 200 OK, “Hello, <username>! Your birthday is in N day(s)” if the birthday of the user is not today
  - 200 OK, “Hello, <username>! Happy birthday!”
  
*PUT /hello/{username}  { “dateOfBirth”: “YYYY-MM-DD” }* this endpoint returns:
  - 400 ERROR, if the username does not contain only letters
  - 400 ERROR, if the date is later than NOW or is not a correct date, for example 1998-00-00
  - 204 NO CONTENT, if the put has created/updated the username correctly
  
## Directory structure  

  - *database/*: This directory contains the database to be mounted in the docker container
  - *flaskr/*: This directory contains the source code and a script for creating the database
  - *tests/*: This directory contains the unittests for the app
  - *Dockerfile*: The docker file to create the app, based on python:3.10
  - *install.bash*: This is a script that builds the docker image, handles the database creation, and runs the docker container mounting the volume
  - *requirements.txt*: This file contains the required dependencies for python
  - *Vagrantfile*: This file contains information for creating a virtualbox based on ubuntu/focal64 with the necessary software to run the api locally
  
## How to deploy  

  For now only details for linux will be provided, however as it is mounted in docker, it easy to deploy in any OS:  
  
### Having a linux machine with docker installed  

If you have a linux machine with docker installed it is as easy as cloning the repository, give run permissions to install.bash and run it:
```
git clone https://github.com/jiahaojizh/Birthday-API.git
cd Birthday-API
sudo chmod +x install.bash
./install.bash
```
### Having a another OS  
If you have another OS you can build your environment using the Vagrantfile:

You will need [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed on your computer. How to deploy a vagrant machine is out of scope of this project.  

## Usage examples:

Currently the API is deployed in the port 80.

GET operation:
  ```curl localhost:80/hello/user```
  
PUT operation:
  ```curl http://localhost:80/hello/user -d "dateOfBirth=1998-09-21" -X PUT```

### System diagram in AWS (Currently)

Currently, our app is deployed in a docker container inside a EC2 instance. However, there are changes regarding to the architecture that are planned to implement to comply with the No-Downtime production deployment in the following section

### Future work

Due to the deadline there are some additions to the architecture that could not be implemented, this section is intended to share info regarding to improvements.

#### No-downtime production deployment

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114239936/193149669-c1878590-987a-4080-904c-2a79ecd387cf.png)

This is a first version of the architecture for a more robust deployment.  
  - An nginx as load balancer is added
  - The load is distributed initially on both servers
  - When there is a new release, one server handles all the load (Green), while the other gets updated (Blue)
  - The load gets handled by the Blue
  - If everything goes fine, the green is updated and the load is distributed again, otherwise the blue handles everything

#### Change database to postgresql or another database with more features
Sqlite was used because it was easy to deploy and test and it does not require much effort. To scale sqlite in a AWS environment, a solution could be to share a volume across the servers.

However a proper solution would be to deploy a postgresql for instance on another docker container to have service/database separated, and tested better or use any cloud service.

#### Add syntax and code quality checkers
To ensure that our code has no vulnerabilities and comply with the standards

#### Automate the pipeline
Adding CI/CD pipelines, for all the lifecycle from testing to deployment

Those are some of the features that are missing among others.
